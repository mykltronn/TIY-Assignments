        <h3>AKA, The Ratel (seriously this time)</h3>
          <p>The honey badger (Mellivora capensis), also known as the ratel, is the only species in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustelid" target="_blank">mustelid</a> subfamily Mellivorinae and its only genus Mellivora. It is native to Africa, Southwest Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Despite its name, the honey badger does not closely resemble other badger species; instead, it bears more anatomical similarities to weasels.</p>

            <p>The honey badger has a fairly long body, but is distinctly thick-set and broad across the back. Its skin is remarkably loose, and allows it to turn and twist freely within it.</p>
